        I'm not too sure what to put in this about me section but here goes. I am an 18-year-old Digital Media student from up North in Carlisle, England.
         I moved down to Bristol to pursue my interests in film, editing and design; so far, I am loving my time here and my aim is to engross myself in
          every aspect of my course and thus improve both my skills as a student and also as a person. 
          I suppose this website is the start of a long and exciting journey, and to show you what I have learned so far from my studies.

        wonderful world of HTML!!" on a default white background.<br><br> This code went very well, I understood it first time and was helpful in understanding the basics of creating a html document with a body and adding my own text.

      <div class ="para3">This is a slider that contains screenshots from my 2nd and 3rd HTML tasks.<br><br>In Task 2 I was assigned to create a web page with the instructions for making a pizza from scratch. This was a very helpful introduction to the bare basics of crafting a website. For instance, the distinguishing of headings (through the h1, h2 and h3 tags), how to create lists using the “ul” and “li" tags and even making background colour. After playing around with the worksheets instructions I figured out how to gradient a background colour, add in images and colour text, all things that I have employed into this portfolio website. This task went pretty well although at that point I was unsure on how to change the width of the text lines, so they are very spread out which is unappealing and harder to take in.<br><br>Furthermore, in the following task - Task 3 - I was able to link a new pre made web page using a custom URL to a page about Cake, that I had to add some layout improvements in such as flex containers around images. This was an incredibly useful task as it helped with finding code necessary for making the layout of a web page cleaner and more structured. I also incorporated further down in the reflection section of this website the URL custom links that I learned here. Overall, the task was successful, and everything functioned as intended.<br><br> <a target = "_blank" class = "Gitlink" id = "Gitlink"  href="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/HTML-Task-2-3.git">GitHub Link</a></div>

From this task I have carried over some of the flexbox knowledge such as setting margins, adding padding, borders etc. into my own website in addition to the key feature of the button navigation bar being implemented into my website - then tweaked to look cleaner and more futuristic.<br><br>However, this website production did not stop in task 4. In task 5 I was instructed to not only further develop the website from task 4, but also link a separate page entirely that could be reached through the press of a button on the top of the web page from task 4 (as shown on slide 2). From this task I learned a lot on styling a website with rows and columns of text/ images and even styling text, like the title font on the first slide, taken from the google fonts library, that has also provided the font for all the headings and title in my own website that blends nicely with the space theme.<br><br> <a target = "_blank" class = "Gitlink" id = "Gitlink"  href="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/HTML-Task-4-5.git">GitHub Link</a></p>

 <div class = container6>
  <p class = "para6"><u>Slide 1:</u><br><br>This poster was very close to being the one I would adapt into my final design. I love this one as it is uses alignment in an interesting way, the centralised logo is rotated and aligned along a diagonal line that separates both the text and the logos "T" & "F" making the logo seem embedded into the core of the design. The line also helps with proximity, breaking up the text in a digestible and interesting way. Furthermore, the use of colour and contrast is great. It uses a single shade of red throughout that is taken from the logo design, the lighter corners that contain natural patterns create almost a gradient effect that leads into and out of the poster. The flow of the poster is from top left down to the bottom right, the design fades into the top text and as your eyes follow down to the next block of text the design fades back out overall giving a natural movement to the design. This is only accentuated by the text blocks being aligned upon separate diagonal margins. The title text has a no fill in order to make the logo the main focal point of the design and make the poster feel less cluttered. However, it is still noticeable as a title due to it being underlined.<br><br>
  <u>Slide 2:</u><br><br>This poster was my least favourite design of all the ones I did. The use of space and its grid layout is good as it is simplistic, thus easy to read and get the relevant information from the different sections. It also has a prominent heading that makes the logo the focal point, and the title “True False” is at an even proximity from the logo, The colour of each word contrasts like in the logo. The text blocks are broken up in an even way by the black line that makes the amount of text seem less daunting to encourage reading it more. If I were to improve this design, I would make the title elements more central within the top section and extend the width of the top text block to reach the end of the bottom section as there is far too much white space there.<br><br>
  <u>Slide 3:</u><br><br>This is my 3rd design, and the one I chose to develop into my final product. I like this design, it’s very bold and there is a lot going on meaning there isn’t much white space. The “True” and “false” are layered beneath the logo for some depth. There are repeated black circles around the design that contrast the red background adding even more layering with the circles containing the text blocks. To improve this design I would change the colour pallet to be a bit lighter and improve my layering of the circles, as the design does look quite cluttered in places.<br><br>
  <u>Slide 4:</u><br><br>This is my final design. I took the inspiration from my third poster and improved upon it. For instance, I made the “true” and the “false” circles layer between the logo for an improved sense of depth but made the logo and circle that backdrops the text have a slight glow to it, in order to contrast them from the rest thus keeping them as the focal points in this multi layered design. The layers are diagonally placed for a nicer flow of reading. The design is also full of various repeated overlapping circles (creating a sense of unity in the design) that fills out the design, leaving just enough white space so that the design doesn’t become overbearing and lose its simplistic feeling. Some of the circles are different opacities and shades of red and keeping the design fresh and emphasising the different layers. The colours have been made lighter and softer when compared to that of the design that inspired it as I find it more welcoming. The main body of text is centralised on the x axis which creates a spot of control in the otherwise seemingly disorganised layers – so the text is very easy to read and process.</p>

 <h1 class = "TYPETASK" a id="type task"><u>Type Task</u></h1>
 <p class = "para7">This Section contains details on my Type task that entailed creating 8 200mmx200mm designs depicting the 8 typographic systems.<br>They are:
    Axial, Radial, Dilatational, Random, Grid, Modular, Transitional and Bilateral.</p>

 <div class="sec6">
     
    <div class="container7">

        <div class="typetask-image-group">
            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Axial.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>AXIAL</u><br>This is my take on an axial type system. It is axial as the groups of text follow the same "line" that’s made more interesting due to the angled axis that they follow. Also, making some of the rectangles represent the invisible lines was a fun way to incorporate my limited ways to use colour in this task.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Radial.png?raw=true">


            <p class="typetask-text"><u>RADIAL</u><br>This radial design uses the midpoints of two circles in order to represent the focal points from which the text "radiates" from. You could think of the circles as little green suns. I like this design as the text is still easy to read and follows the traditional natural reading style of top to bottom, even while the text is at unnatural angles. The only complaint I would have on this design is that it is quite bare and boring, I could have improved this by splitting up the text more thus adding more rays and perhaps fill the canvas with more ransom sized circles.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Dilatational.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>DILATATIONAL</u><br>This is one of my favourite designs. Each circle has a slight difference in its employment of the dilatational type system. For instance, the first one has two layers of text at different starting points, the second circle has 3 layers that are all aligned centrally around the circle and the bottom left circle has text that leads onto the smaller circle next to it. overall, I believe this to be a fun design and I would improve upon it by maybe making the curved text follow a smoother path as they are not perfectly curved around the circles.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">
            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Random.png?raw=true">


            <p class="typetask-text"><u>RANDOM</u><br>While this was by far the most time-consuming type system to make, upon reflection I hail it as one of my favourites. I had a lot of fun using the text manipulation tools on illustrator like underlining, scaling different letters, angling them, colouring them and making them follow angles paths. My improvement for this would be that it’s not as "random" as I could have made it, for instance there are a lot of complete words on it, and I should have included a lot more shapes and text to fill the page's white space more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Grid.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>GRID</u><br>This has to be my least favourite type system that I made. I find the grid type system to be boring for the most part, but my example is at the lower band of them. The page is far too bare, the spacing is awkward and there is far too much white space in some of the boxes. My only positive on this design is that it’s the only one I utilised my colour on all the text.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Modular.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>MODULAR</u><br>This design is modular as there is a display of consistency. In my design the consistency comes from the same repeated squares - that contain the text elements. These squares are in two repeated rows with slight deviations due to the descending nature of the rows in order to make it look more intriguing. The choice to have circles attached to a corner of each of the squares serves the same purpose as the shifted rows - making the design more unique.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Transitional2.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>TRANSITIONAL</u><br>Transitional is definitely the one that I found the most fun. using the curvature tool, I created invisible lines to make natural layers resembling that of layers of sediment with smooth dips and elevations; then using the type on path tool in illustrator I copied the text onto these lines. Then added some thick lines to emphasise the layering of the text and shapes in the corner that push the idea of layers building. I believe the text to be well spaced and appropriate in length so much so that they make convincing natural layers - following the transitional style.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="typetask-image-group">

            <img class="typetask-image" src="https://github.com/GULLLYYYYY/Assignment/blob/main/Images/Bilateral.png?raw=true">

            <p class="typetask-text"><u>BILATERAL</u><br>The central alignment of the text and pattern is what makes this design bilateral. Its a simplistic yet serviceable design that is easy to read, understand and is well spaced - although the large white space from the text to the margins is quite prominent. I liked the ease of information digestion in this type system so much so I included it in the previous section (Carp Task) of this website. </p>

I found myself consistently coming back to it when coding the various sections because it was a great visual to compare my website to. The sections are all broken down evenly and given equal attention in the wireframe, so no section is left underdeveloped. Because of this I rarely deviated from this plan as you can tell. However, the areas that I didn’t stick to the wireframe were in the HTML coding sections where I alternated the positions of the text and screenshots for each task and the wireframe did not include a theme which I later changed to a space theme to compliment the gradient purple background.</p>

Another important thing I considered when creating my website was the users. The users of my website I considered was primarily the teachers of my course, but also the likes of my family, friends and myself. I believe it is important to always consider target audience as it influences how the website will be laid out etc. and so it is easy to judge whether or not the website has achieved its goal from a user standpoint. This could be seen in how I intend there to be simple button sliders for images accompanied by easy-to-read text blocks that explain the images in a detailed yet concise manner. Also, in how I aim for the website to be single scroll and there to be a navigation bar at the top of the website for effortless navigation through the website for my family, some of whom struggle with certain websites.</p>

    <p class = "para10">This project was a challenge for me coming from no experience in HTML and CSS, but I am happy with the outcome. An aspect of the website I really like is the overall space vibe of the project which is helped greatly in part to the images and then the falling stars at the start of the project that flow well with the descending nature of the website that I had acquired and tweaked from a web tutorial on the following link: <a target = "_blank" class = "link" id = "link"  href="https://codepen.io/YusukeNakaya/pen/XyOaBj">Link!</a> Although there is an issue that arises from the implementation of this and that is that on some systems the website lags toward the top of the website. To improve this, I could remove some of the stars, so the website has less to load. In addition to the stars, the glowing text was a big help in pushing the space theme which I found <a target = "_blank" class = "link" id = "link"  href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_glowing_text.asp">here</a> and wrote into my code<br><br>I also like the sliders in this project as I can add a lot of sample images without running the risk of the website becoming overly cluttered. However, these were very hard to get to work, get the right dimensions for and position; so, I found myself constantly coming back to YouTube tutorials and help from comments on coding websites. If I were to use these again, I would add more easing effects on the transitions for the sliders, so they appear smoother.<br><br>There is one somewhat glaring issue with this website and that is that when loaded on different screens such as a MAC or a laptop, the positioning of some of the elements shift to awkward positions. Whilst this problem is not too important for this project, it is one I'd dedicate more time to fixing in projects yet to come.<br><br>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed making this project. Whilst I found it incredibly difficult and annoying at parts it was equally rewarding to see everything come together in the end and my progression from HTML task 1 to now. I am very proud to present you this website and hope to impress you more in future.</p>
